Project: Diwali Sales Data Analysis
Overview

In this project, I analyzed Diwali Sales Data to uncover key consumer behavior patterns. The goal was to identify which demographics contributed most to sales and what product categories were the most popular.

Approach & Techniques

Data Processing: Loaded the dataset using Pandas and cleaned it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Seaborn & Matplotlib to visualize trends in gender-based purchases, sales by occupation, and product preferences.
Key Insights:
Gender-based sales: More purchases were made by female customers.
Top customers: Married women (aged 26-35) from UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, were the biggest spenders.
Popular product categories: Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most purchased items.
Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook

Impact & Learnings

This project helped me strengthen my data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills. Understanding consumer trends through data can be incredibly useful for businesses to optimize marketing and sales strategies.
